# Persistence Smoothie

This application is a Rails 3 example of a combination of SQL and NoSQL systems in a single application presented during the talk [Persistence Smoothie: Blending SQL and NoSQL](http://intridea.com/2010/3/30/persistence-smoothie-blending-nosql-and-sql-at-confoo) given at Confoo 2010 as well as RubyNation 2010. It represents a simple storefront with some social features and utilizes MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB all within the same application.

Obviously this is demoware and was constructed in just a few hours. There are some rake tasks for pulling some data in from Amazon and it is generally brittle and untested code. Enjoy!
